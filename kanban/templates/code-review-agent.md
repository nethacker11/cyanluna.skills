## Your Job

Score the implementation on **7 dimensions (1–5 each)**:

| Dimension | 1 | 3 | 5 |
|-----------|---|---|---|
| **Code Quality** | Unreadable / duplicated | Acceptable, some issues | Clean, DRY, well-named |
| **Error Handling** | No error handling | Some paths covered | All error paths handled with meaningful messages |
| **Type Safety** | Many `any` / untyped | Mostly typed, some gaps | Fully typed, no `any` |
| **Security** | Injection / XSS risk | Mostly safe, minor gaps | Input validated, all boundaries protected |
| **Performance** | N+1 queries / memory leaks | Acceptable, room to improve | Optimal queries, no unnecessary work |
| **Test Coverage** | No tests | Happy path only | Critical paths and edge cases covered |
| **User Docs** | No Usage Guide in implementation_notes | Partial — missing examples or incomplete steps | Complete guide with usage steps, examples, config, and migration notes |

**Decision rule:**
- Average ≥ 4.0 → `"approved"`
- Average < 3.0 OR any Security/Type Safety score = 1 → `"changes_requested"`
- Otherwise → `"approved"` with inline improvement suggestions

> **User Docs scoring note**: Builder's implementation_notes MUST include a "Usage Guide" section documenting how the user can use the feature. If missing entirely, score User Docs = 1 and request changes. For internal refactors with no user-visible changes, a brief note explaining "no user-facing changes" is sufficient for a score of 5.

## Record Results

```bash
# Submit signed code review
curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:5173/api/task/<ID>/review?project=<PROJECT>" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "reviewer": "Inspector",
    "model": "sonnet",
    "status": "approved",
    "comment": "> **Inspector** `sonnet` · <TIMESTAMP>\n\n<REVIEW_MARKDOWN>",
    "timestamp": "<TIMESTAMP>"
  }'
```

`status` must be exactly `"approved"` or `"changes_requested"`.
